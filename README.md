CS101 Syllabus and How-to
This page explains the structure of CS101 and how to go through it. CS101 teaches the essential features of computers with some neat image and code exercises. CS101 is geared for people with zero prior computer experience apart from using a browser.

Some lectures center on experiments where you write little phrases of code to get a feel for how computers work and their limitations. There are other lectures on wide range of computer topics: hardware, software, security, and so on (complete list below).

CS101 is not a full, professional coding class. Instead, CS101 gets at the essential ideas of computers, their powers and limitations.

Grading and Deadlines
There are lectures and exercises every week for 6 weeks. Instead of a separate deadline each week, we have one big deadline at the end of the course -- August 28, 2014. All exercises must be completed by August 28th. This provides flexibility for people starting late, or missing a week to go on vacation. That said, it is best to work on each week's exercises when assigned, since that's what we'll be talking about on the forums that week, rather than letting unfinished exercises pile up

A net 80% or better score across the exercises is required successfully complete the course. People successfully completing the course will receive a Stanford statement of accomplishment.

Videos and Written Documents
For each video section, there's a companion written document that explains the topic (this is the document Nick is scrolling through during the video). The document for each video is on the same page as the video, but lower down. You can go try any of the examples shown in the video.

Code Exercises
For the code-writing exercises, there is a code area with a Run button that works just like in lecure. You can edit and run your code, looking at its output. When you have an exercise answer you think is correct, try the "Submit" button below and to the left of the code area. This will check your answer, giving either a green-checkmark (correct), or a red X (not correct). You can submit any number of times. Due to a quirk in the open-edx platform we're running on here, clicking the Submit button also erases your output, but not your code. You can click the Run button again to see your output again.

Browser Checker
Any recent browser should be capable of running CS101. To check that your computer and browser are powerful enough for CS101, visit the "CS101 Browser Checker" page on the Course Info tab.

Topics:
The nature of computers and code, what they can and cannot do
How computer hardware works: chips, cpu, memory, disk
Necessary jargon: bits, bytes, megabytes, gigabytes
How software works: what is a program, what is "running"
How digital images work
Computer code: loops and logic
Big ideas: abstraction, logic, bugs
How structured data works
How the internet works: ip address, routing, ethernet, wi-fi
Computer security: viruses, trojans, and passwords, oh my!
Analog vs. digital
Digital media, images, sounds, video, compression
History
I did an earlier version of CS101 on Coursera. For this 2014 version, I started with the Coursera version, and I'm re-doing some pieces and adding some new pieces. This version is running on Stanford Online, which uses the open source open-edx platform.  I did the original work on how to use Javascript in the browser and images for teaching with the support of Google while working at Google back in 2010.
